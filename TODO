Improve Grid implementation
    1. Memory allocated by the main program as a consistent
    desing decision?
    2. Efficient memory use, right now uses space to allocate
    ALL the agents, which is a waste of memory.
Good random procedure
malloc vs declaration:
    declaring the arrays as "float pos[ NUM_AGENTS * DIM]"
    in **the main program** instead of allocating them at the
    library level makes the program 10% faster.
distance2 called a lot, make cache version
Clean modular implementation of consensus protocol + interaciton
More behaviors:
    1. Vector noise in Vicsek
    2. Advanced models with attraction and repulsion
